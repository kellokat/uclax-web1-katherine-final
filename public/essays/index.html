        <h2>01. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>

        <p>HTML, CSS, and JS are used together to create websites.  HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It is a programming language used for webpages.  Web browsers take the markup and use it to display text, images and content in a web page.  It is used to specify the content of web pages.</p>

        <p>This is different from CSS.  CSS is the Cascading Style Sheet. An HTML document is styled using this language.  In other words, the CSS contains the styling language for the web page.  Each attribute has its own title and can be specifically written to produce specific colors and fonts.  It is also used to configure layouts.</p>
        
        <p>JS deals with scripting.  HTML and CSS donâ€™t.  JS stands for Javascript.  It is a scripting programming language for the web and deals with the behavior of the website. Content created with it runs on the web browser.  Without Javascript, most of the content or functionality on the web page would be useless.  It is the scripting programming language that creates dynamic content for a web site.</p>
        
        <p>While HTML specifies the content, CSS specifies the styling.  JS is used to program the behaviors and actions of the web page.  They are used together to create a website.</p>

        <p>What are single page apps?</p>
